Hello, I'm astah (or astaroth).

I chose this nickname to remember my beautiful history with the game [Grand Chase](https://www.koggames.com/grandchase-classic-br/).

Currently, I am learning C at [42sp](https://www.42sp.org.br/) school, and during my spare time, I'm delving into Elixir and Python for real-world application development at [udel](https://udel.study).

I'm an aspiring enthusiast in the world of mathematics and its intricacies, a realm where I find myself in a love-hate relationship. I also have a keen interest in physics and chemistry, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge during my free moments.

In the realm of computer science, I hold genuine interests in computer graphics, low-level programming, compiler design, and architecture design, among other areas.

I'm also starting to write blog posts, and you can check them out on my [blog](https://astahjmo.github.io/).

You can find me on Discord as astaroth#0373 or 'astah.'
